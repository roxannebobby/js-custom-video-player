# Custom Video Player

This project uses HTML, CSS and Javascript to develop a custom player, including a customized control bar for playing, pausing and stopping the video.

The project was developed utlizing a tutorial by Brad Traversy. When possible my code strays from the tutorial to practice the skills taught in the lesson.
